# custom_malware_file-scan-APT

This script uses the VirusTotal API to scan a file for malware. The scan_file() function submits the file for scanning and returns a resource identifier that can be used to retrieve the scan report. The get_report() function retrieves the report for the specified resource and prints the number of antivirus scanners that detected malware, as well as the detailed scan results for each scanner.

To use this script, you will need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your VirusTotal API key, and PATH_TO_FILE with the path to the file you want to scan. You can obtain a free VirusTotal API key by creating an account on their website. Note that this script is a simple example and does not include advanced malware detection techniques such as behavior analysis or machine learning.
